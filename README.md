## Bachelor Project: CRDT for Fonto

To conclude our bachelor program for Computer Science and Engineering at the TU Delft, we made a research prototype about Conflict-Free Replicated Data Types. Our CRDT is based on a [logoot implementation](https://github.com/t-mullen/logoot-crdt).

## Installation

```
git clone git@github.com:Martinn1996/Fonto-CRDT.git
cd Fonto-CRDT
npm install
```

## Editor
Our editor makes use of blocks of texts. Multiple users can edit the text inside the blocks. Blocks can also be moved, merged and splitted.
